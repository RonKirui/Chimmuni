# Child Immunization Monitoring App

# Project Overview
The Child Immunization Monitoring App is a mobile application designed to help parents and guardians keep track of their child's immunization schedule. The app aims to improve immunization coverage by ensuring that children receive timely vaccinations, therefore, preventing missed immunization appointments due to forgetfulness or misplaced physical records. In addition to providing reminders for upcoming immunizations, the app allows for booking or reallocating appointments when necessary, making it easier for healthcare providers and parents to coordinate.

# Features
